/*
You are given a 0-indexed string s that has lowercase English letters in its even indices and digits in its odd indices.
There is a function shift(c, x), where c is a character and x is a digit, that returns the xth character after c.

For example, shift('a', 5) = 'f' and shift('x', 0) = 'x'.
For every odd index i, you want to replace the digit s[i] with shift(s[i-1], s[i]).

Return s after replacing all digits. It is guaranteed that shift(s[i-1], s[i]) will never exceed 'z'.


Example :

Input: s = "a1c1e1"
Output: "abcdef"
Explanation: The digits are replaced as follows:
- s[1] -> shift('a',1) = 'b'
- s[3] -> shift('c',1) = 'd'
- s[5] -> shift('e',1) = 'f'
*/

class Solution {
public:
    string replaceDigits(string s) {
        
        for(int i=1;i<s.size();i+=2){
            s[i]=char(s[i-1]+s[i]-'0');
        }
        return s;
        
    }
};
